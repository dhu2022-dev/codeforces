# Codeforces

This repository contains my Codeforces contest solutions and selected practice problems.

## Structure

- **YYYY-MM-DD_* folders**  
  Solutions written during live Codeforces contests, organized by contest and date.

- **PracticeProblems/**  
  A curated set of problems used for deliberate practice.  
  The problem list is based on recommendations from an ICPC World Finalist and is worked through gradually.

- **cf_template.py**  
  Personal template used for Codeforces contests.

## Notes

- This repository is a working log, not a complete archive.
- Solutions may be written in different languages over time.
